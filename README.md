Trails are overburdened by congestion, and hikers are often unaware of proper trail etiquette and information. This poses a risk to the wellbeing of trail ecosystems, and a safety risk to hikers themselves. Alaka’i offers a variety of features to provide hikers with reliable and accurate information, along with the ability to reverse trail damage through donations.
