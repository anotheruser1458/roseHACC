# Alaka'i Trail Directory
A web application that allows state officials and the general public to monitor the foot-traffic density on any of Hawaii's hiking trails. This was our team's entry to the [Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge](https://hacc.hawaii.gov) (HACC) 2021, which got us invited to the finalist day where we presented the project to judges and an audience.

# Trail Catalog
Our catalog offers a one-stop-shop for all the information any hiker may need. Trails are displayed on cards and highlighted on the map using the Leaflet map API.

Clicking on a trail's card reveals more useful details like the route description, difficluty, total distance, and average time it takes someone to complete the hike.

# Safety & Etiquette
Also, a dedicated safety and etiquette page ensures hikers are informed and responsible.

# Traffic Information
Real time traffic data is available to users through colored paths. Encouraging hikers to plan based on the traffic indicators reduces the burden on trail ecosystems and local communities.
Our website provides access to past and future predictive data generated by the reservations feature.

# Reservations
Our reservation feature provides a solution to overburdened trails by aligning the interests of hikers and the state
Nobody enjoys hiking on busy trails. When reservations are made, our color indicators update and hikers are made aware of when other users plan to hike. Naturally, hikers will make reservations at less busy times reducing traffic without strict state enforcement.

# Donations
Through our donations page, Alaka’i offers users the ability to support their favorite hikes through the Stripe API.

# Safety Alerts
Requested by Hawaii’s hikers, Alaka’i now has a safety alerts system. Users can optionally create an emergency contact that will be automatically contacted 6 hours after their scheduled reservation.

# Challenges And Accomplishments
The biggest challenge our team encountered was the management of large datasets across multiple local development platforms. Passing the necessary data to every corner of the project was difficult and clunky at first, but through a large-scale overhaul of our database and restructuring to use AJAX requests, we were able to clean up our code and easily access our database information. Another large accomplishment for the team was the sudden delve into web development. A majority of our team has little to no prior experience with web development, yet we were able to use this competition as an opportunity to jump in head first into new territory, which significantly accelerated our growth as programmers. We were able to learn more about web design, proper coding practices, and maximizing the use of version control systems.
